Find or build the binary, stop whatever runs, copy the binary and the

Six projects each carried their own copy of this, differing by a service name

There is no `platform.system()` in this file, and that is the design rule
rather than a coincidence: the moment orchestration starts asking which system
it runs on, the platform boundary has leaked and the single core becomes a
