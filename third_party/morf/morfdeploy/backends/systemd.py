"""systemd backend — Linux x64 and ARM64.

Reproduces what the install-service.sh scripts did, including the details that
look incidental and are not: the unit is generated from a template committed in
the project, and `daemon-reload` is issued before enabling, because systemd
otherwise acts on the unit it read at boot.
